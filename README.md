# ROS 2 Learning & Research Playground

This repository serves as a personal learning space for exploring concepts within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) framework. It documents initial steps and fundamental understanding gained through various ROS 2 tutorials.

### Current Content:

* **`add_two_ints_server.cpp`:** This file represents an early exercise in setting up a basic ROS 2 service server using C++. It was developed while following introductory ROS 2 tutorials to grasp the core concepts of services and client-server communication.

### Purpose & Learning Journey:

My primary goal with this repository and related exercises was to quickly build foundational knowledge in ROS 2. As an IT intern aspiring to work with robotics and embedded systems, understanding ROS 2 is crucial.

While this specific repository currently only contains one example, I continued to engage with numerous other ROS 2 tutorials and concepts in parallel. My focus quickly shifted to applying this knowledge directly to my **"Pick and Place Robotic Arm" group project**, where practical implementation and problem-solving became the priority over pushing every tutorial step to GitHub.

This repository, therefore, signifies the very beginning of my hands-on journey with ROS 2, demonstrating my proactive approach to learning complex robotic frameworks. It underpins the foundational understanding that was then applied to more complex, integrated projects.

### Technologies & Concepts Explored:

* **ROS 2:** Robot Operating System 2 (core concepts, workspace setup)
* **C++:** Development of ROS 2 nodes and services
* **Services & Clients:** Understanding inter-node communication patterns
